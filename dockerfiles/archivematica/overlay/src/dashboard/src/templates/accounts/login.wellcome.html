    <!--
      Wellcome note: This differs pretty heavily from the upstream Archivematica
      login screen.

      At time of writing (25 February 2020), the Archivematica login screen
      prioritises a username/password login form.  OpenID Connect is relegated
      to a small link below the form.

      While it is in theory possible to log in this way (every Wellcome user
      will have an underlying Archivematica user account), it's another
      username/password to remember.  We'd rather people use Active Directory
      to log in (aka OpenID Connect), so we've modified the login screen to
      emphasise that option.

      If you still want to log in (e.g. as an admin user), the log in form
      is hidden behind a <details> element.
     -->

    <p>If you have a Wellcome account, you can log in to Archivematica:</p>

    <p>
      <center>
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" onclick="window.location.href='{% url 'oidc_authentication_init' %}'">Log in</button>
      </center>
    </p>

    <!--
      If you log in successfully with Active Directory, but Archivematica doesn't
      know who you are (= you don't have access permissions), it redirects you back
      to this login screen.

      It would be nice if this message only appeared after a failed login attempt,
      but I couldn't work out how to wire that up (and it would mean plumbing through
      more of Archivematica).  This is a permanent message as a compromise.
     -->
    <p>
      If you are having difficulty logging in, you might not have permission to access Archivematica.
      Please speak to an Archivematica admin.
