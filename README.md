# archivematica-infrastructure

[![Build status](https://badge.buildkite.com/110c72015ef5319e8fbec009b7f3e477ccc7ccab1a732e5194.svg)](https://buildkite.com/wellcomecollection/archivematica-infrastructure)

This is the configuration for our Archivematica deployment.

Archivematica is an open-source service for processing born-digital archives, which we use to:

*   Analyse files in the archive â€“ including virus scanning, file format identification, and fixity checking
*   Create a metadata description of the archive that can be read by downstream applications
*   Upload the archive to our permanent cloud storage

The original application was created by [Artefactual], and we run a lightly modified fork.

[Artefactual]: https://www.artefactual.com/



## Requirements

Our deployment is designed to:

*   Allow archivists to manage our born-digital collections
*   Ensure our born-digital collections are processed consistently and stored safely
*   Avoid "reinventing the wheel" when processing born-digital archives



## High-level design

    WSS --> I{IIIF builder}

```

The user uploads a "transfer package" to an S3 bucket.
This contains the born-digital files, plus some metadata.

Anything that gets uploaded to this bucket is sent to Archivematica for processing.
It does its checking and analysis, and creates a [METS file] which describes the contents of the archive.
This becomes part of the BagIt bag, which is uploaded to [our storage service].

Successfully stored archives are then sent to iiif-builder, which uses the METS file to construct a IIIF Presentation manifest to describe this archive.
(If we can make the archive publicly available.)

## Documentation

We have [documentation](./docs) about our Archivematica deployment, which includes:

*   How-to guides explaining how to do common operations, e.g. create a new transfer package
Reference material explaining how the storage service works
Notes for developers who want to modify or extend the storage service



## Usage

We run two instances of Archivematica at Wellcome:

*   A ["prod" environment][prod] that holds our real collections
*   A ["staging" environment][staging] that we use for testing and development

Each instance of the Archivematica is completely separate, and talks to a [separate instance of the storage service][storage_environments].
They don't share any files or storage.

We distinguish between two categories of born-digital archive:

*   Catalogued collections, which have been appraised by an archivist and have a catalogue reference (e.g. PP/MDM/A/3/1a).
    These go in the `born-digital` space in the storage service.
*   Accessions, which is an uncatalogued collection of files received from a donor.
    These have an [accession number][accno] (e.g. 1234), and go in the `born-digital-accessions` space in the storage service.
