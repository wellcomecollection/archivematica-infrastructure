Born-digital material which is processed by Archivematica is stored in the **Wellcome storage service**, which the permanent storage for all our digital collections.

### Future work (as of November 2022)

Newly-stored material will be sent to **iiif-builder**, which constructs a IIIF Presentation manifest for the born-digital archive. This will allow the archive to be served via DLCS.

This will then allow us to present the archive on a **works page** on wellcomecollection.org, e.g. allowing users to browse and download the files in an archive (if access conditions permit).
