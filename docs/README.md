# Introduction

**We use Archivematica to process and store our born-digital archives.**

This processing includes:

* Analysing files in the archive, like virus scanning, file format identification, and fixity checking
* Creating a metadata description of the archive that can be read by downstream applications
* Uploading the archive to our permanent cloud storage

Archivematica is an open-source application created by [Artefactual](https://www.artefactual.com/), and we run a lightly modified fork.

## Requirements

Our deployment is intended to:

* Allow archivists to manage our born-digital collections
* Ensure our born-digital collections are processed consistently and stored safely
* Provide metadata in a consistent format that we can (eventually) use to display born-digital archives on wellcomecollection.org
* Avoid "reinventing the wheel" when processing born-digital archives

## Documentation

This GitBook space contains information about our Archivematica deployment, including:

* How-to guides explaining how to do common operations, e.g. create a new transfer package
* Reference material explaining how Archivematica works
* Notes for developers who want to administer or debug our Archivematica deployment

It supplements the information in [the first-party Archivematica docs](https://www.archivematica.org/en/), by adding information specific to Wellcomeâ€™s deployment.
